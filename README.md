# Daily Goals Android App

## 📌 About
A simple offline Android app to help you track and complete your daily goals.  
No ads, no accounts, no cloud – everything is stored locally on your phone.  

## ✨ Features
- Add and manage your daily goals  
- Mark goals as completed with a single tap  
- Local notifications to remind you at chosen times  
- Minimalist and distraction-free design  
- Works fully offline  

## 🤔 Why I built this app
- I wanted a **simple offline tool** to track daily goals  
- Most existing apps are overloaded with features, ads, or require cloud accounts  
- My priority was **privacy and focus** – everything stored locally, no distractions  
- The app should do one thing well: **help me stay motivated and consistent with my daily habits**  

## 🛠️ Tech stack
- Java (Android Studio)  
- SQLite (local storage)  
- Material UI components
